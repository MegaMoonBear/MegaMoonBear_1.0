## Who am I?

I like to **dance**, garden, go to go to movies with my husband and son and to live music events at small venues. I work at Hollywood Feed, a pet supply store. I have had many jobs in my *53 years*.

My favorites are: 
 - Languages and cultures
 - Animals 
 - Japan
 - Habitat conservation, especially wetlands to benefit humans
