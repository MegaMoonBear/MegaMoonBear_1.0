## Who am I?

I like to **dance**, garden, go to movies with my husband and son and to live music events at small venues. I work at Hollywood Feed, a pet supply store. I have had many jobs in my *53 years* - giraffe and husky caretaker, English and Japanese teacher, education and wildlife researcher, and socio-economic and habitat use analyst. 

I am in coding school to upskill from analyst to Data Scientist of the last 15+ years of my career. 
1. SQL *self-taught novice*
2. Git
3. Markdown
4. HTML *from next week*
5. CSS *from next week*

My favorites are: 
 - Languages and cultures - studying Spanish, Japanese and ASL *American Sign Language*
 - Animals - Mammals are my first love, but my love has grown to wild birds, bugs, and herps - amphibians and reptiles
 - Pizza, kale salads, yogurt, and cheese      *Wallace!*
 - SciFi, Korean and European dramas, dance and other arts *Gundam for my son*
 - Habitat conservation, especially wetlands for benefitting humans
