## Who am I? 🙋‍♀️❓

I like to **dance** 💃:, garden 💮, go to movies with my husband and son 🎥 and to live music events at small venues 🎷. I work at Hollywood Feed, a pet supply store 🐕🐈‍⬛. I have had many jobs in my *53 years* - giraffe 🦒 and husky caretaker, English and Japanese teacher 🧑‍🏫, education and wildlife researcher 📚🐻, and socio-economic and habitat use analyst 📊. 

I am in coding school to upskill from Analyst to Data Scientist of the last 15+ years of my career.
